`Yae`
<p>Did you know this part of the day is known as twilight?</p>
<p>It lies between day and night and light and dark</p>

<p>It was 70,000 years ago. Just as our ancestor bravely scattered themselves around the world</p>
<p>It seems to me that humanity must constantly be on the move looking for somewhere that is not here.</p>
